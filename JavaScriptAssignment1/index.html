  <p>This JavaScript assignment shows how you can use ES6's new WeakMaps to privatize fields. It is possible to use Map instead of a WeakMap or even a pair of arrays to mimic this solution. But using WeakMap has one significant advantage — it allows Person instances to be garbage collected.</p>

<p>The WeakMap holds keys weakly and that makes both the Person instance and it’s private data eligible for garbage collection when a Person object is no longer referenced by the rest of the application.</p><br>
