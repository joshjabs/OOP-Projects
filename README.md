# Class Projects for CSCI 375

# Intro ES6 - Single Object: DONE
    JavaScript sample of Classes and Inheritance.
    Location Class has several properties and functions.
    Human Class extends Location class and adds a color.

# Assignment #1 - JavaScript Flavor: DONE
    This JavaScript assignment shows how you can use ES6's new WeakMaps to privatize fields.
    It is possible to use Map instead of a WeakMap or even a pair of arrays to mimic this solution.
    But using WeakMap has one significant advantage — it allows Person instances to be garbage collected.
    The WeakMap holds keys weakly and that makes both the Person instance and it’s private data eligible
    for garbage collection when a Person object is no longer referenced by the rest of the application.

# Assignment #1 - Java Flavor: DONE
    Has multiple classes that extend the car class
    Main function uses a Car type ArrayList
    Tried to compile using JDK command line tools
    Compiles now with wrapped build commands - /bin/bash -c 'command'

# Assignment #1 - C++ Flavor: DONE
    Dynamically creates a Student object from console input.
    Student class contains getters and setters for several private variables.
    Public ID is the only publicly accessible property.
    Additional little to_string() function prints all private class variables.
    Compile with g++ -o main main.cpp

# Design Patterns: DONE
    Write a sample program using the design pattern presented in class: Strategies.
    Build a clone of your teammate's program in a different language: Proxies.

# Diamond Structure in C++
	Use virtual funcitons to create a diamond structure
	Liger joins together Lion and Tiger which both use base class Animal

# C++ Playing With Inheritance
    Not a class assignment. Just thought I'd keep it here because it's relevant. Can't get to build.
