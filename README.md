    Main function uses a Car type ArrayList
    Tried to compile using JDK command line tools
    Compiles now with wrapped build commands - /bin/bash -c 'command'

#Programming assignment # 1: IN PROGRESS
    Make an object-oriented framework for a sample academic application:
      At least 3 classes
      At least 1 virtual method  
      Written in C++ (using good habits, header and source files)

#Programming assignment #2:
    Use the CONST structure for a set of classes
    (probably the same set as assignment # 1).

#Diamond Structure in C++
	Use virtual funcitons to create a diamond structure
	Liger joins together Lion and Tiger which both use base class Animal
